# Clean TikTok URL

Takes a TikTok URL as input and converts it into its privacy-friendly shortened form (tiktok.com/t/ format). The tool handles various TikTok URL formats (including tiktok.com, www.tiktok.com, and vm.tiktok.com domains) and extracts the video ID to generate a clean, shortened URL.
